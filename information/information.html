        Students taking this course may use the notes as part of their reading
        and reference materials. There might be many mistakes and typos, including English
        grammatical and spelling errors, in the notes. It would be greatly appreciated if those students,
        who will use the notes as their reading or reference material, report any mistakes and typos to

<dd> <i>
An Unified Proof for the Theorems of Alternatives (pdf)
</i> 
<dd></i> 
Theorems of alternatives are very useful in applied mathematics in various ways, which is also a main focus of the mid-term exam for MAT3320. 
The purpose of the present paper is to prove theorems of alternatives in a unified way by directly making use of the Farkas Lemma.
